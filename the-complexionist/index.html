        <h3 class="about__subtitle">Medical Skin Therapist in Longmont, Colorado</h3>
        <h3 class="about__subtitle">Serving Boulder County and Beyond</h3>
        <p>
          Having been trained in the latest esthetic techniques at two different accredited institutes &mdash; the San Francisco Institute of Esthetics and Cosmetology ~ a Paul Mitchell School, as well as the Rock Creek Laser Institute & School of Esthetics, located in Superior, Colorado, Amy D. Ramirez is an especially well-versed skin therapist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since becoming licensed as an esthetician, Amy has written several articles regarding skin care, beauty treatments, health, and wellness for the Examiner as well as writing content for Rock Creek Medispa's website; she has likely shared tips and techniques with thousands through her writings. In addition, she helped train an incoming group of Colorado esthetic students, preparing them for state licensure.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Complexionist, Amy aspires to be considered "the cream" of those working within the "skindustry". Having continued her education in resurfacing sensitive skin, and from successfully managing her own skin sensitivities, Amy is both empathetic and well-equipped to treat a variety of clients, helping them achieve optimal outcomes as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being a beauty enthusiast, Amy is passionate about fitness, fashion, fine food, and family. She lives in Longmont, Colorado (Boulder County) with her husband, her four year old daughter, and a giant chocolate lab named Bubba.

          <p>
            TiZO is perhaps the most effective, safe sun protection line available today. It is a mineral-based line that is ideal for all skin types. It was first created for patients whose sensitized skin needed serious protection post-surgery and/or laser resurfacing. Certain TiZO formulations feel exceptionally cosmetically elegant on the skin and actually improve the appearance of the complexion! Used daily by The Complexionist herself as well as her young child, some products are perfect for little ones and trusted by some of the most discerning estheticians. TiZO's products can only be ordered through affiliated estheticians, including The Complexionist. The Complexionist's own private line of photoceutical products will soon be replacing TiZO's.

            PCA resurfacing protocols can be wonderfully beneficial for clients with sensitive skin. I work with PCA's enhanced Jessner peels, blended TCA peels, and retinoid-based solutions as well. Retail PCA Skin products are highly recommended prior to a peel.

            Although not partnered with this company, I am fortunate to have some professional Dermalogica products avilable for purchase. (Retail Dermalogica products cannot be ordered through me.) This reputable line is used exclusively, at the San Francisco Institute of Cosmetology & Esthetics (SFIEC), which is where I first learned to work with skin other than my own. Dermalogica products are formulated by the International Dermal Institute (IDI), where I will continue my education at its Denver location.
