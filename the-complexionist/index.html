        <h2 class="about__title">About Amy</h2>
        <p>
          Having been trained and certified in the latest esthetic techniques at two different accredited institutes &mdash; a Paul Mitchell partner school in San Francisco, California as well as matriculating at the Rock Creek Laser Institute & School of Esthetics, located in Superior, Colorado, Amy Diana Ramirez is an especially well-versed skin therapist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amy has written a slew of articles regarding beauty treatments, skin care, health, and wellness for the Examiner as well as writing content for Rock Creek Medispa’s website; she has shared tips and techniques with thousands. Moreover, she helped train an incoming cohort of esthetic students at Rock Creek, preparing them for state licensure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amy hopes to be considered “the cream” of those working within the “skindustry” in Northern Colorado. Having continued her education in contemporary resurfacing treatments with minimal downtime, she is equipped to evaluate and treat a variety of skin care clients, helping them achieve optimal aesthetic outcomes as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an undergraduate concentration in health & wellness, plus a masters degree in psychology from Columbia University, Teachers College, she applies her expertise as both founding owner of Holistic Skin Therapies and as lead esthetician, applying her skills in a hands-on capacity. Functioning as a holistic practitioner,  she heeds that a client’s total mind-body wellness status impacts their body's largest organ ~ the skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being a licensed esthetician, Amy is registered with the State of Colorado as a psychotherapist. Although she is not specifically practicing psychotherapy at present, she naturally applies her counseling skills to better serve skin care clients in a much more dynamic manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever one’s skin situation &mdash; be it break-outs, rosacea, dehydration, or “age management”, Amy is an empathetic expert who is enthusiastic about facilitating improvements in the health and appearance of those who seek her services.
