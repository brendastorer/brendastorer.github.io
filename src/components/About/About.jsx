          Brenda is a Silicon Valley native who moved to NYC to escape the tech scene and pursue a creative career. But after trading coasts, she discovered that tech is actually really creative and pretty awesome. Sheâ€™s been making websites since the early days of Geocities and professionally for the past decade in development and design roles. As an award winning conference speaker, she has been around the world presenting talks on her greatest love, CSS. She loves being an active member of the NYC tech community and helping to organize local front-end meetups.
